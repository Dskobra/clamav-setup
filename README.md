# clamav-setup

These scripts download and setup clamav, user account and configuration files.

* setup.sh - Main launcher. Linux only.
* config-tool.py - Copys both the freshclam and clamd sample files then edits and saves them
                    in order for clamav to parse them (complains if you don't edit them).
